# --- Settings for the custom-background package
#
# custom-background		A package that dynamically lets you via e.g. thinstation.conf.network specify what
#				background-image should be used. This is useful because you can set one background
#				in your build.conf and later on change the background. My usage (the reason why I created
#				this package) was that I wanted a red background image with a warning text telling the
#				user that he didn't receive the thinstation.conf.newtork settings and thereby the
#				computer most likly would not work, and instruct the user to reboot or contact support.)
#
#				Then in the thinstation.conf.network you set another (the normal) background image.
#
#				To use this package:
#					1. Copy all background images to /build/packages/custom-background/root/.custom-background/
#					   (actually, the path doesn't matter, just make sure the images are available on the
#					   client at boot-time)
#					2. In build.conf make sure that package custom-background is included
#					3. In build.conf set your default/fallback/warning background that shall be used
#					   e.g. CUSTOM_BACKGROUND=/root/.custom-background/warning-image.jpg
#					4. In thinstation.conf.network set your normal/default background that the user
#					   normally shall see, e.g. CUSTOM_BACKGROUND=/root/.custom-background/normal-image.jpg
#					5. Done!
#
# CUSTOM_BACKGROUND	The path for the background file to use.

#CUSTOM_BACKGROUND=/root/.custom-background/dlanordic-orange-1920x1200.jpg
