# --- Description of the set-resolution package
#
#   This package gives you the ability to change the resolution on your Thinstation without the need to reboot
#   It will also write the resolution into $STORAGE_PATH/thinstation.profile/thinstation.conf.user
#   so that the resolution change is saved after reboot.
#
#   This package works great together with the package "local-install" where you install Thinstation locally
#   on the computers hard drive:
#       1) include the package local-install
#       2) in thinstation.build.conf set
#           STORAGE_PATH=/mnt/local-install/part2
#           STORAGE_CONFIG1=/mnt/local-install/part2
#       3) you are now good to go... Use the menus under "Display Resolution"
#          or run e.g. "set-resolution.sh 1024x768"
#
#   There are no specific parameters for this package, it just contains the set-resolution.sh script and relies on
#   the STORAGE_PATH parameter.
#
#
# SET_MONITOR_DPI           Set the DPI
#
# SET_MONITOR_EXPAND        How to expand multiple monitors. Default is to mirror the display over all monitors.
#                           If you want to expand the display (dual monitor) you normally wan't the value 'right'
#                           Valid values are: up|down|left|right|mirror
#
# SET_MONITOR_AUTOSCALE     Scales all monitors so that the display image fits on all monitors. If one monitor has
#                           a lower resolution then it will be scaled (zoomed out) so that the whole display image
#                           is fitted on that monitor. Default is true but you can set this value to false if you
#                           for some reason do not want the image to be scaled to fit on the monitor.
