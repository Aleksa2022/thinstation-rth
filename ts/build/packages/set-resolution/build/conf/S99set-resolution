# --- Description of the set-resolution package
#
#	This package gives you the ability to change the resolution on your Thinstation without the need to reboot
#	It will also write the resolution into $STORAGE_PATH/thinstation.profile/thinstation.conf.user
#	so that the resolution change is saved after reboot.
#
#	This package works great together with the package "local-install" where you install Thinstation locally
#	on the computers hard drive (/dev/sda):
#		1) include the package local-install
#		2) in thinstation.build.conf set
#			STORAGE_PATH=/mnt/disc/sda/part2
#			STORAGE_CONFIG1=/mnt/disc/sda/part2
#		3) you are now good to go... Use the menus under "Display Resolution"
#		   or run e.g. "set-resolution.sh 1024x768"
#
#	There are no specific parameters for this package, it just contains the set-resolution.sh script and relies on
#	the STORAGE_PATH parameter.
